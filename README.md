# Real_Time_Image_Capture_and_Processing_Pipeline_for_Pant_and_Soil_Identification
## Development of a Real-Time Image Capture and Processing Pipeline for Plant  and Soil Identification in Agricultural Fields

<p style="font-size:14px;">
This project aimed at creating a real-time image capture and processing pipeline for field 
environments using Raspberry Pi cameras and a Mask R-CNN model. The successful 
execution of the project demonstrated the potential of integrating Internet of Things (IoT) 
devices with machine learning for real-time field environment monitoring. The pipeline 
provided updated snapshots of the field, which could be viewed and evaluated through a 
web interface.

 This project's primary motivation was to address the prevailing challenges in real-time 
agricultural monitoring, which often involves laborious and time-consuming manual 
surveillance. Developing an automated system can greatly enhance the monitoring 
efficiency, enabling faster detection of any anomalies and thereby aiding in timely 
intervention. In this regard, the implementation of machine learning models for image 
analysis is instrumental, as they can accurately identify and classify various elements in the 
field, such as differentiating between plant and soil regions

## Overall, this project aspired to integrate hardware and software components into a functioning system capable of delivering real-time agricultural field monitoring.
